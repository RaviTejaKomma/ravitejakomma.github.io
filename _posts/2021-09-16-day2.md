My plan is to write about my 
- Tech learnings
- Personal finance 
- Journey of starting up a tech startup and a Quick Service Restaurant
and many more.....

During this lockdown, I had a chance to delve into stock market investing, trading, crypto, taxation, and other finance-related things which have helped me to manage my money in a better way. 

I have also realized that there is a huge gap in financial education in our country. I would love to share my learnings through blog posts so that anyone who is just getting started in their career can plan their finances in a better way and commit mistakes that I have done.
